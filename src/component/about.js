        As a career shifter from IT Support to web development, I am determined to develop my skills
        further and use my technical knowledge to create innovative web applications. I am excited to
        work with the tech stack of MySQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js and use Redux for state
        management. My goal is to be a valuable development team member and continuously learn and
        grow as a web developer.
